what i thought about weeks but through days

stronger weekend work

debugs AFTER projects, '.5'
	"trying to learn english from red underlines"
lesson plan of a project - debuggin
	"how many of you left this piece of code in there"
	- things like 'why passing the whole obecjt'
tie the debugging and code review
only hit the debuggings on friday

my technical, specs, all
then they follow up with their empathy and downlow code reviews

not coincidence that this and battleship were good days

reviews of key topics before moving on

fe -> serve it -> jquery reactive -> ssr -> router -> laurens routes -> jquery async -> preact -> react

getting started with javascritp scotch, all in es6

dripfeed es6 with comments, old/new
