this is the projects we'll go through in class

each one builds on the last, you can always make the next one by refactoring the last one

each project introduces a new concept.

in each project folder you'll find:
	- project description and learning objectives
	- list of resources to study these objectives
	- link to example finished code
	- empty file for your dev plan
	- empty directory for your documentation
	- empty directory for your code

work ahead at your own pace, but stop after completing each one to go over it with us
